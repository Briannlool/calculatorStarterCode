# CalculatorProject Response
## Response 
1. This project is for me to write out the proper functions and 
 return codes for the calculator to work properly. 
 1. This project works with functions that tell the variables what 
 to do when the user of the calculator inputs something and a result is returned when the
 equal sign is pressed. 
 1. If I had more time, I would try to add more functions such cube rooting a variable.
